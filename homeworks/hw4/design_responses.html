					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Some things I learned from the article were ways to increase accessibility by decreasing a product's reliance on color. For example, using symbols and text in conjunction with colors to signify errors, or implementing more colorblind-friendly textures and patterns. These are all things that I'm fortunate enough not to need in everyday life, but it's very important to consider accessibiliy through others' points of view. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was going through all of the resources the author provided, such as outside sources, examples, and websites to check how accessible one's own work is. It was really helpful to see how these principles can be implemented in others' products as well as in your own. I'll definitely be referring back to some of these resources in the future.</p>
