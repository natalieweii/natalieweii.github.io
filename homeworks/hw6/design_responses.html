						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from the article is the importance of "natural" movement in constructing a cohesive experience for the user. Even though it's all happening on a screen, the animation principles incorporated into website desin should still somewhat reflect the real world; the human mind is perceptive to minute details like friction and acceleration. If this attention to detail is missing, animations can look jarring or disjointed, interrupting the user's experience and impeding the product's function.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was all the different graphics and animations the author included to illustrate the large impact that even subtle differences can make. Even small choices like the type of transition one uses in their animation can greatly affect how said motion is percieved by the user, and it's important to keep these principles in mind. Having clear-cut examples to examine and interact with helped a lot in truly understanding the subtleties of design, from a user's perspective, and what mistakes to avoid.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another."</p>
						</li>
