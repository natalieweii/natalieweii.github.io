						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>Something I learned from the article is how susceptible consumers can be to deceptive practices in design. It's interesting how our knowledge of human psychology can be used to both elevate products and manipulate consumers. I think it's also important to note that the victims tend to be part of vulnerable communities that are unfamiliar with technology, making the exploitative nature of these practices even more chilling.</p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part of the article was seeing how dark patterns have evolved along with the way that consumers interact with the Internet. Some of the most iconic Internet scams are fake emails or pop-up ads from the 2000s. Now, a lot of dark design seems centered around social media and the online news cycle. It seems like some designers use dark patterns to generate as much engagement as possible, even at the expense of accuracy or the user's wellbeing.  </p>
