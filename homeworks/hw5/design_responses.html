                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article was how much even small design choices can influence the overall feel of a product. Features such as the shattering animation in Never-stop's Travel Map, as well as the lagging touchscreen and ripple animation in Arvin's Index & Sidebar Animation, all make the user's choices feel more impactful and "real." Gal Shir's Cryptocurrencyâ€”Transaction Confirmation features a slow loading bar that probably isn't functionally accurate, but creates a more satisfying experience for the user.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was how it featured a diverse range of aesthetics, highlighting different yet effective approaches to design. The contrast also drew attention to the common threads between designs, like fluidity and strong color language. Even the apps with similar functions all exhibited very different perspectives.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration was the Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel because of how organic it felt. The animations were both incredibly clean as well as natural because they exhibited good use of animation principles. For example, the wave initially overshoots its motion before oscillating as it settles. Other details such as the touch tab lagging behind when triggered and the small particle effect all add to the satisfying feel of the design.</p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8/10! I think that seeing the designs in action really helped demonstrate the principles that we've been learning about.</p>
