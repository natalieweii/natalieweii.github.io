					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from the article was the importance of identifying your intended audience. Before reading this, I hadn't even thoughts of things like child-friendly fonts versus senior-friendly fonts. I now know that taking tge extra step in emphathizing with one's audience is, understandably, an important part of design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when the author introduced the Modular Scale. As someone new to web design in general, it's always really interesting to see just how purposeful and precise design truly is. Everything has a purpose, even if the average viewer wouldn't bat an eye. I wouldn't have thought that something as seemingly simple as font sizes could involve so much mathmatical precision. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Use type as a way to emphasize information to communicate meaning." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
