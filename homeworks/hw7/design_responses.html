					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from the article is that in terms of design, a little can go a long way. For example, even if it seems counterintuitive, the principles of emergence and reificaiton show that simpler, less complex elements can potentially be even more effective or recognizable than fully rendered ones. By harnessing what we know about human psychology, people can build more effective designs with less effort.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was all of the illustrative graphics and examples of the design rules. Getting to learn and experience the four Gestalt principles firsthand, followed by seeing how they can be incorporated into UX design, was really helpful in demonstrating how people put these tools to use. It was also cool to compare what worked and what didn't in the simple app templates provided for each principle.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing previous experiences or visual patterns and connecting the dots. It has its own “weird” way of perceiving shape and form, grouping information, fill in the gaps to draw the big picture." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
