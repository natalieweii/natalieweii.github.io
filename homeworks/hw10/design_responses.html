							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I thought that the article presented a neat way of looking at design by tying it to specific aspects of human psychology. It's a great example of the interdisciplinary nature of design, which is just as dependent on the science of cognition as it on the aesthetics themselves in order to be truly effective. I also enjoyed learning about the different types of attention in relation to information processing. The example graphics were helpful in demonstrating these effects in real time.</p>
